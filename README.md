Projet 3 - OpenClassrooms - ohmyfood

## Project goals

This project is part of my course to become a full stack developer. It focuses on CSS animations. The client wanted a website that could be used as an application, I focused the design on the smartphone size screen. The website is responsive, but it is meant to be used on a smartphone.
